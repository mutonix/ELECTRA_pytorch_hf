hey .. i installed a pata card in my comp with __number__ hd s on it dmesg says the card is there ( it seems to be using the libata module ) but the drives on the card are not showing up .. has someone experience with these kinds of cards
maybe the dmesg has some clue can you post it to pastebin ??
thats a bit hard because its a different comp with no net but the line that caught my eye was ata2 sata link down ( sstatus __number__ scontrol __number__ )
it is sata or pata ??
its a sata card with a pata connector as well
that s the normal msg for a not used sata port ( i have three of them on my pc )
there are no extra devices ( such as sda or hde )
what chip does the card uses
do you see sata_via and pata_via loaded
libata under lsmod shows the sata_via sata_promise
i try a modprobe
nope modprobe pata_via module pata-via not found
nope modprobe pata_via module pata_via not found sorry
try this one then « sudo modprobe via82cxxx »
that is already loaded .. part of ide_core in lsmod but no __path__ for the disks :(

i assume you mean __path__ is there a configure script in that directory
nope
is there a readme or install
yea it only tells me this program has no warranty
when you ls is there anything that shows up as green
libfmodex so numbers here and yamipod
run __path__
updating playcounts ... is what it says
along with an error about not copying the lib to usr/lib and i'l haveno audio which is fine i just need to put songs onto my ipod
do you have a link to this package
__url__
ok i tried to put songs onto my ipod in rhythmbox and they are not there but it lists them
now i open yamipod and it says the songs are there on my ipod but they are n't when i liten to it
wtf how do i finalize my aditions to my ipod
calm down i am trying to see what this package is i do n't have an ipod so i am not completely certain
i m trying ot copy songs onot my ipod i doubt this will work though
or it says to do something and that is the best way to do it
ok the readme says to do this sudo cp libfmodex so __number__ __number__ __path__ && sudo cp yamipod __path__
i do n't need audio for yamipod i just need to put songs onto my ipod
after you do that run yamipod i do n't understand why drag and drop does n't work in rhythmbox i ve tried gtk pod and it would n't even detect my ipod telling me i had some __path__ error

yes well the topic does not lie
it will be ready for testing when the merge is finished
i m sure that mirror will be back up eventually
er are you sure about that
the livecd image no longer carries an rc tag and i m pretty sure it s final
please stop pasting in the distrowatch stats every day
people like it
people who need to see those stats can go to distrowatch themselves please do n't paste it into the channel all the time it s hard enough to follow all the scrollback without stuff like that
it s once a day and we will have a vote who wants it pasted vote now who every doesnt also vote now
great even more scrollback if people want it they can get it from distrowatch please stop pasting it in here
why should i stop people like to know and do n't goto distrowatch daily let alone off irc
people want to know other people find it inconvenient and that it puts them out i ve asked you nicely please just stop it
of course it will run
( note that x was originally developed on pdps )
ok how many mhz is a __number__
cat foo cpp start writing end with ^d
try it
just sit tight and wait
no
too late by far for hoary

what s wrong with using numbers in chmod
i m curious because i ve always used the number arguments to chmod
if i have to explain it it s probably hopeless but what just happened should give you an idea
it s horribly error prone and totally unnecessary
i ca n't remember the question long enough to type the answer
well you can be retarted without being a shit :)
and vice versa but neither belong in this channel
sure
yes the default is to run it from inetd
the program name is in telnetd
well then doubly he did n't delete telnetd by installing inetd :)
yes i know but he is getting a message with a blank socket number not if he has no partitions

noob question here when it says log of gnome how do i do that
*log out of gnome
the off button on the top menu bar
oh they re sending you to a virtual console alt-ctl-f1 - f6
so either f1 through f6
exactly there are __number__ virtual consoles you can use you can reach them at any time during your session
hangover from the pre gui days and still useful
i m back :) i did n't know how to get out of that console when i hit alt-ctl-f1-f6 does it log me completely out of gnome or can i return to it and my open applications
sorry the gui is on alt-ctl-f7 :)
thanks dude much appreciated
another question is the console just like a terminal window for most purposes yes no cut and paste ( but if you install gpm you can cut and paste between terminals )

what shockwave is not available for linux ...
it is available but not good
i ca n't find it .... i do n't think it exists ... can you give me a link
there is a plugin swfdec for linux which isnt good and you can install windows version in linux with tweaks here
__url__
thats what i said it isnt good for linux
swfdec is for flash ... and shockwave in wine is not really shockwave in linux ...
... ok ... so there is no shockwave for linux :)
i agree here is something for us __url__ i just built a machine today should i manually set swap or should i just use entire disk which will be more beneficial

what kinda computer are you installing to
did you install 32bit or 64bit os
then you just need to enable the right repositories in your __path__ list file
then become root by typing sudo -s
and then you can aptitude update && aptitude upgrade
there s graphical interface but as long as you can type ... it s better to learn the linux filesystem anyway
i did that command
now you can delete everything in that file and copy this sources list file by highlighting it and then pasting it by middle clicking into the text editor !!

is this g15composer a linux app
my g15composer won t work with ttf fonts
and the error is
jes
yes
g15composer symbol lookup error g15composer undefined symbol g15r_ttfload

no game cd that has music tracks
loo for it in __path__
you do n't read __path__ devices directly normally
i didnt say that developers need to make exceptions to data cds with audio tracks
ah i see what you mean
wasnt shouting out of context thats sternly saying something
i know only teasing ;)
a useful trick use a mirror that s not one of the ubuntu country ones like find a university or other institution it s much faster
now if dist-upgrade did that as well
i ve been using mirrors.kernel.org for everything including dist-upgrades
could be suggestion for apt if main one fails to connect try alternates .? or does it do it yet
no not that i know of gutsy has a nifty guide to available repos and will even help you choose the best one ( software sources under admin )
the most critical thing i can tell you about gnupg is treat your secret key like gold frustrating to misplace or delete it
create a revocation certificate burn it and the secret key to different cd s and store them in different places i keep losing keys so i do n't currently have one
yes i was listening but had nothing to offer on what you followed up on i was still sharing the first question just general experience but i m done :)
yes and i do understand your frustration i was sharing mine and it did n't help yours at all
yes i guess i assumed he had that :)
i meant on the same hardware
heh xfce was much faster on the p3 i ran
lol it definitely has potential it s long but definitely true

yeah it installs a bootloader and whatnot but you need an ubuntu disk image to create it
i know that but if i write the image to the usb drive using dd it does n't work
yeah you ca n't just copy the thing over the disk creator does a bunch of magic making sure that everything is copied bit-for-bit
yes the communty help documentation has an article on it
and there is a special filesystem it uses called squashfs that needs to be set up properly for everything to work
ok so imagine i do n't have a disk creator is there a set of instructions for how to install the iso to a usb drive and make it bootable
__url__
ah well that might be a graphical issue it might be an issue with the usb stick you re using or it could be a wholly different problem that i ve never heard of :p
centrino wireless ..?
ooops sorry
__url__
when it booted did you at least see the menu giving you the options about how to use the usb
no it was just black i ll try following the instructions again and get back to you
ok sorry about not being more helpful
not your fault i m not really sure why you all have created an iso that is n't bootable *every*one else has :-/
how is your display connected to your computer
it s a laptop when i say black screen i should have said blank screen blinking cursor
it sounds like the image did n't get written correctly you might try using unetbootin
__url__ if that does n't work then i would have to say there is probably something wrong with the flash drive you re using
i take it you got the liveusb to work yeah i had to use unetbootin annoying but such is life i m more baffled by the lack of a tor package ..

i do n't think reinstalling x is what you want
what happens when you start your computer
now it says that im having problem with gnome power management but before i didnt say anything
how do i check that
what are the last few lines of dmesg
open a terminal and type dmesg | tail
then copy-paste the results to paste ubuntu com
ok think i have to close irssi to check ... or is there anyway to split the terminal window ..
you are in the console you can press alt+right to go to another console
ok thanks
what was the name of the log again dmsg
type dmesg | tail
dont see anything strange here
what about in the file __path__ __number__ log ( type less __path__ __number__ log )
at least no ee
what happens if you run sudo service gdm start "? ( that should start the x server )
srtart job is already running start
could this be in another terminal window maybe
check terminal __number__ ( ctl+alt+f7 ) and __number__
go back to the console you were in and try sudo service gdm restart an underscore blinking in the upper left corner
1 i do n't think reinstalling x is what you want what happens when you start your computer now it says that im having problem with gnome power management but before i didnt say anything how do i check that what are the last few lines of dmesg open a terminal and type dmesg | tail then copy-paste the results to paste ubuntu com ok think i have to close irssi to check ... or is there anyway to split the terminal window .. you are in the console you can press alt+right to go to another console ok thanks what was the name of the log again dmsg type dmesg | tail dont see anything strange here what about in the file __path__ __number__ log ( type less __path__ __number__ log ) at least no ee what happens if you run sudo service gdm start "? ( that should start the x server ) srtart job is already running start could this be in another terminal window maybe check terminal __number__ ( ctl+alt+f7 ) and __number__ go back to the console you were in and try sudo service gdm restart an underscore blinking in the upper left corner

so question about using my wifi adapter my notebook has an internal intel pro/wireless 3945abg network controller if i go lspci it shows up so i take that to mean that the hardware is detected and a driver is installed when i type iwconfig i see lo eth0 irda0 sit0 but no wifi0 or wlan0 is there something else i need to do use the wireless device
did you install additional drivers for your __number__ card
no i have n't installed any additional driver sfor the card
i have read a few sites of installing ubuntu on notebooks that use this card and they all say it works out of the box with __number__ and __number__
i have not installed wpasupplicant package maybe that could be it
you do n't need wpasupplicant to see your device
i have the same card as you ... i forget what i did to make it work but i believe there are some nonfree drivers
there is a sourceforge project iw3945.sf.net i think there is also the possibility of using ndiswrapper i think
non-free drivers you mean binary drivers maybe from intel
you might want to check out this link __url__
its hard for me to use the web right now i am in console only mode right now installing kubuntu-desktop right now but that has a few hours remaining and do n't have lynx installed :(
care to paraphrase that for me
do you have linux-restricted-modules-generic installed
i am not sure this is a fresh ubuntu console-only install right now
so besides installing irssi i have n't done anything
i can install that package though
i think you ll need it in the bug ( not really a bug ) they show output of cat __path__ 0c\ __number__ __path__ i have a __path__ directory all the files there

the lines are simply cp __path__ song mp3 thedirectoryinwhichiwantthem
uh i m not sure what i need to understand i got your pm but my script is full of lines that only differ as far as the filename is concerned
and the filenames constitute the problem since they have spaces
i ve just tried to make an absolutely trivial copying script by search and replacing a playlist
yes the paths are with spaces
it s very very long simply lines like this
are you quoting the paths that have spaces
and what happens instead
what editor did you use to write it
do this cat -e thescript and paste a sample line here cat -e thescript and paste a sample line here

isnt it supposed to go up when i plugin the adapter
you mean ac power
yeah to the laptop
no it is only supposed to go up when you run cpu-intensive tasks
good :)
64bit supports more ram and is a bit faster especially when it comes to numbercrunching and memory i/o intensive apps such as video encoding
stefg i see thanks
have you enabled the proposed repository if so you can work out exactly what this update is with apt-cache policy packagename apt-cache show packagename
no but version numbers
also you well have to protect the braces e.g. {} or \{\}
maybe it s mounted
nope
and you ve started it with gksudo
yep i can do things with the free space but i can not make my ext3 use the free space
can you pastebin the output from sudo fdisk -l for that disk
__url__
you re looking to expand __path__ into the space you freed by removing __path__
no sorry i see that would n't make sense as sda2 is swap
yes :)
sda3 i want to exapand is there free space behind sda3

not finals yet i swear i am reading up on all the lectures at this point not just the last one :\
i m at cygwin s site and i m a bit confused is it as similar to remote desktop
it is a unix like environment for windows as such it will run x as a client allowing you to remotely connect to x running on some remote computer .. now that i think about it i do n't recommend it unless you enjoy a challenge
if you just want to ssh into your server try putty :) yeah its possible but it involves getting x running under cygwin and then setting up a remote connection with it it will involve reading a few howtos

is there a tool to control network manager from the command line
hi
you can use __path__ it will supercede network manager
thanks but i really want to switch between nm profiles from a shellscript
the file will be used between all profiles
__path__
__path__ can hold wireless profiles as well as pppoe profiles

sure
typo sorry but then network manager cannot run simultaneously

hutch you gotta set it to usb headset manuly in the ubuntu sound settings
hutch i had that issue easy fix
great what is it :d
in preferences>sounds>devices i have all them set as usb sennheiser headset oss and the test button works but firefox still doesnt work
currently sound playing in cedega and hence it wont play atm but earlier when cedega wasnt running other apps would play fine but not firefox
grr
i think flash is being odd
maybe i will try reinstall it or something
flash and or firefox
how do i go about doing that nah i did flash after firefox
couldnt find package flash-nonfree
why ca n't ubuntu play from two applications at once
well its a usb device
mine is too its a sennheiser pc166 but when i have __number__ applications open playing sound both stutter horribly does it have to do with usb using oss instead of alsa
when i choose usb sennheiser ( alsa ) and try the test button it gives an error and cant play back
how do i switch it to alisa
reinstalled flash youtube still no sound and the video is *slightly* choppy
ok how can i update them or whatever
lol so where should i go from here
i just installed ubuntu __number__ lol what speakers :/ these are like $150us headphones lol

i unchecked always open in browser window but it is still not spatial nautilus

i suspect zsnes is non-free software
erm zsnes is free
erm looks like freeware ... and not free-software
not a lot
you get above
turns out znses is entirely free software but it uses i386 asm code .... it mill be able to run in amd64 but it may or may-not be a fiddle ;-)
its probably best to just run i386 ( which works fine on amd64 ) until true mixed-i386-amd64 comes out ;-) ( maybe in edgy )
is that going to be possible i was n't aware of that
well its in one of the edgy spec things
would it be possible to upgrade from 32bit dapper to 64bit edgy though
not sure ... probablfy need the system/side reinstalling but be able to keep your homedir/settings most-likely
that will work ;-)
which cd ver etc
desktop-live or desktop-alternate
erm normal i did n't know what the alternate one was
that will work ... ;-)
the desktop is a live cd .... like knoppix ... and has an installer that is ( sometimes ) problematic at present but usually fine ... not suitable for upgrading an existing install
the alternate cd is text-based installer/upgrader like previous ubuntu cds
maybe ... if its not a supported raid then that wont work ;-) -- it might be a sis fakeraid
if its one of those fakeraid things then you can just use linux raid instead also the alternate cd is necessary to do lvm/raid installs

on the new ubuntu installer when do i set the root password
the root password is unset ( therefore disabled ) by default for security reasons
we would encourage you to use sudo when you need root functionality :)
that s pretty good i guess but does n't sudo have security risks
like what
not sure myself but i ve read some things on it i think the idea for ubuntu is to stop users from running as root for their normal user

i m thinking that permissions may not be set properly .... but i m not sure
did you specify the location of __path__ in __path__
yes
ah so it s mounted already
are you able to run a program like nano from the command line
yes
the computer seems to start normally until i get "... fail !" and then it drops to a command line login
what happens when you do sudo __path__ d/gdm start
i get a fail
specifically what is the error message
i do n't get verbose error messages
just nothing happens
it says starting gnome display manager fail
the file __path__ __number__ log might contain hints
nothing seems out of the ordinary in there paste the output of this in the channel grep __path__ __path__

is there a link to say what has how much support
ubuntu packages are usually synced to debian sid during the beta cycle
what version is sid
sid is always unstable
however many packages are completely replaced or heavily modified ( for good or worse ) debian __number__ has __number__ __number__

ibut is not to set permis right
i intend chmod use is possible under ntfs
ljl thanks
i do n't think so
it s not a filesystem driver though just a stand-alone application which might be a good thing ... depends what you want
your nickname certainly does ring a bell
you say rc local is not executed why
that script please
__path__ local not __path__ local - but i suppose that was a typo try grep rc local __path__ d/* does that show up with anything
uh add that repository to your sources list
i think so :)
that will be because the other repo has a more recent version of the package i guess
it
it s likely that you can achieve that with pinning but i ca n't guide you there
__url__
thank you that seems like what you want just change * into the package name i guess

to remove the other copy you compiled go to the source dir and make remove or make uninstall
go into the source dir and type more makefile ( i think that s it ... )
thanks :)
ok ... ( forgot __path__ <)
note - anything with clean in it isnt what you want
youll see headers for each operation that make can run on that source ball
look for anything that would be like remove or uninstall
trash/pkg-config- __number__ __path__ __number__ 8/ libs/libgli b.a
does it cause you any functional problems
yes ... ca n't compile gtk+ programs oh that sucks ... not really sure other than removing it what else you should do
